there are 2 types of components in Next.js - SERVER AND CLIENT
for client components we use - "use client" flag at the top of the page - so basically a client component can have logic - like hooks - which cannot run on a server or backend - therefore we make them on the frontend - thats why they are client components.
server components are rendered on the server and generally contain information that is crucial.
